# Timed-Quiz-Generator
# Created a timed quiz
# Gave it some color to catch the readers attention
# Created a 30 second timer per question that restarts after time is up or test ends.
# I had trouble creating a refesh page to the timer once it stopped. 
# Need to create a clearInterval perhaps to refresh it
# Hope you like it!
